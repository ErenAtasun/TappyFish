##About the Game
Tappy Fish is one of my first game development projects, created to help me learn the basics of game mechanics and development. In this simple arcade game, players control a fish that must avoid obstacles and collect points. The gameplay is easy to understand, but it becomes increasingly challenging as you try to beat your high score.

##Key Features
Basic Controls: Tap to make the fish jump and avoid obstacles.
Increasing Difficulty: The game becomes harder the longer you play.
High Score Tracking: Try to beat your own high score with each attempt.
